# GetItDoneTimer
Awesome study/work timer web-app developed independently using JavaScript, HTML, CSS. 

**Link to App:** https://angadvirk.github.io/Projects/GetItDoneTimer/index.html

## What I Learned:
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript Fundamentals.
* Designed & Coded the App independently, from scratch.

## ToDo:
* In 'Total time you'll work' calculation, also show what time it will be 
  when the study session ends. 
  Eg: Total time you'll work: 4 hours (9:50 AM to 1:50 PM).
* Bonus fun feature: Show custom messages based on the 'Total time you'll 
  work'.
* UI Revamp?
